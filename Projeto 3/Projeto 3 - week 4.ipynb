But the statistic is almost always pushed passed that into the realm of 97% of scientists believe that the climate is changing rapidly and that if government doesn't do something, our children are going to die (to be more mild than recent claims of 2050 apocalypse).\\n\\nWhen any climate scientist does come out on tv and say something like the last half of the previous paragraph, there is plenty of reason to be skeptical of their bias. First off, their career and therefore their livelihood is much better off if climate change is seen as an imminent catastrophe. It will make their work seem more important and make it much easier for them to get research grants and to get paid. Secondly, these are people whose whole identity is tied to climate change, which would make it hard to be unbiased.\\n\\nClimate scientists have always adjusted their models because they weren't accurate. To be fair, this is because the climate is extremely complex. But because of that, it's reasonable to be skeptical that they got it right this time.\\n\\nAnd to the idea that science is unbiased, yes, the scientific method itself is unbiased. But, the way science is presented (reports/statistics) can 100% be biased/misleading. And, most scientists are going to spend most of their training/work in academia, which is very, very left leaning.\", \"&gt;Elon fan here, I just like what he does for the environment and I think his inventions are cool.\\n\\nUnfortunately, deriving ones wealth from disparaging nuclear in favor of solar subsidies, eroding mass transit in favor of luxury EVs and ride shares, and getting most of your profits from government space launch contracts really isn't the most environmentally friendly plan.   \\n\\n\\nDon't get me wrong: there are loads of technology and innovation that his projects and companies have helped developed, but it's a big of stretch to describe him as some environmental savior when his plan to combat climate change is to fly with his fellow billionaires to mars and leave the rest of us with a fucked planet. \", \"Well the republicans sure doesn't act like it.

Plus we have a massive pile of first hand accounts writing of buffalo hunts that were enormous in scale, causing the deaths of tens  of thousands of buffalo, official government policy that was to go after the buffalo to get rid of the natives food supply, and other accounts from the time suggesting that hunting was the primary cause for the extinction of the buffalo at the time.\\n\\nEdit: unlike alternative options like climate change, and a space-object impact in north america causing the megafauna extinctions of the Americas, which have quite a few papers, I cannot find a single academic paper though several different searches like bison extinction, bison boom bust, bison population explosion, that theorizes the idea that bison went through a population boom that predated the bust, so I have no idea whatsoever where you got that theory.\\n\\nEdit 2: to my embarrassment, the first appearance of the overkill hypothesis, Martins paper theorizing it, was in 1967, not in the mid 1970s like I thought.', \"Let me preface this by saying that i speak about the majority of conservatives/republicans when I make disparaging remarks- just the vast majority of them.

Things aren't representing other things one to one, but it's trying to make the case for a particular answer to a contentious question. It does so by arguing things could play out the way  presented in a counterfactual scenario that has a different balance of factors involved. Note that this requires, unlike most popular fiction,  a world without protagonists who always succeed no matter the odds.\\n\\nAs with any thought experiment, you can apply this in reverse. If you find some aspect of the film unbelievable, that will reveal to yourself what it is you actually do believe.\\n\\nIt's written by Marx-influenced American leftists, so I honestly think the question they are aiming at is the 'false consciousness' problem. The basic principle involved is covered by the quote 'it is very difficult to get someone to understand something if their salary depends on them not understanding it'. In general, people will overwhelmingly tend to make only those mistakes that serve their own interests, and/or those of their social group.\\n\\nTo apply that to climate change, it is generally considered that the class self interest of the poor is not best served by the planet losing habitability points.\\n\\nThere are several  main competing theories why climate change mitigation policies are, despite that theory, generally less popular in the  low-income classes represented by the 'Don't Look Up' crowd in the film. I'll call this group the DLUs; it should not be controversial as to what this group represents in reality. If that is 'false consciousness', where does it come from?\\n\\nOne is that the DLUs have inherent wisdom and do actually always know their own self interest better than any outsider. The film argues against that by presenting a scenario where the comet does actually hit.\\n\\nOne is that the DLUs  are stupid, and simply don't know their own self-interest. The film argues against that by presenting a scenario that shows them persisting in their views despite overwhelming visible evidence that literally no-one could be stupid enough to make an honest mistake about. Hence the film's title.\\n\\nAnother is that the DLUs are all and entirely about racism; the film argues against that by picking a scenario that has nothing to do with race.\\n\\nA popular one is that the DLUs are lied to by organised propaganda campaigns. And this is the key to why it works as a thought experiment rather than metaphor. Because obviously in the case of climate change, fossil fuel companies and/or the Russians do exist, do spend money and do have influence. Whereas in the film's chosen scenario, noone wants the comet to hit. The DLU movement is self-generating mix of true believers and scammers. So if you find the film's presentation of the DLU movement as plausible, then that is an argument against the simple propaganda model.\\n\\nThe answer consistent with the scenario shown in the film is that the DLUs are what they are primarily because of a lack of any organised movement representing their actual interests. The propaganda that exists is mostly in favor of a false solution to the problem that serves as a cover for elite self-interest  (first mining, later escape). They correctly reject that, but have no means to know where to stop rejecting.  In the absence of a plausible solution, they either stay in denial, or accept their fate, as the female protagonist does.\\n\\nAgain compare to WWII, when union movements were strong. For example, in the UK, it was the Labour party that led the drive to replace Chamberlain with Churchill. That sense of national unity working towards a goal allowed a total war footing. Which led to much more effective solution development, and so a virtuous cycle of trust leading to effectiveness and back. One that worked so well that the UK is in fact still somewhat coasting off it in 2022.\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False\\\\_consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consciousness)\\n\\n[https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Colonization#Habitability](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Colonization#Habitability)\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\\\\_Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_Debate) \\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevin\\\\_Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevin_Boys)\", \"&gt; Please don't bore me with this.\\n\\nRight.

This means that the recently observed \"pause\" in surface warming may tell us nothing about longer-term global climate change.\"\\n\\n\\nIf your actual radiation measurements at TOA are not consistent vs. measured temperatures....\\nJust maybe you are not measuring correctly.\\n\\nContinually assuming that there is excess heat and determining that the excess heat is in the Ocean, or in Africa, Or in the Arctic, or behind Mom\\'s sofa, by use of models and even poorer measuring techniques, sets you up to look like a fool. \\n\\nModel runs are not measurements.

The economic relationships that we\\'ve got used to over the past 25-30 years are bound to be affected by that.”\\n\\nHe says the forces that shaped the global economy in recent decades, making China the world’s factory, and Russia and the Middle East the world’s petrol stations, will not “disappear completely” but “security will matter a lot more.”\\n\\nGlobalisation looked like an unstoppable force until the financial crisis, helping to drive prices lower, improve product choice and ultimately raise living standards.\\n\\nIt has brought “huge benefits and not least lifting a third of the world population out of poverty”, according to OECD chief economist Laurence Boone. “But there are some signs with Covid and with what\\'s happening now that this may not be what the future will look like.”\\n\\nA more uncertain world that has emerged in recent years is forcing governments and companies to rethink where they get everything from the gas that heats homes, to the microchips that underpin modern technology - and if it is even realistic to become more self-sufficient in such an interconnected world economy. \\n\\nBusinesses are shortening the length of their supply chains to stop them being disrupted while production is being brought closer to home.\\n\\nEconomists argue, however, that there are limits to the de-globalisation trend, particularly as it will likely raise prices and reduce competitiveness. Consumers will seek out the cheapest products and businesses that have higher costs will lose out.\\n\\nChaar at Lombard Odier expects there to be “regionalisation” and reorganisation of supply chains but argues that globalisation will not roll over.\\n\\n“We still have a globalised world, globalised supply chains, competition and a company is going to try to optimise its production and its cost,” he says.\\n\\n“If one company regionalises and the price of its products doubled compared to one that says, ‘okay, I\\'m still going to take the risk to produce in China’ - who wins the market?”\\n\\nBNY Mellon’s Dhar agrees there are limits to the deglobalisation shift “because the law of comparative advantage dictates almost that if you’re going to be a viable firm, you’ve got to source from the cheapest possible place”.\\n\\nAny drive to become more self-sufficient in food is likely to run up against these limits. The UK produces around 55pc of what it eats but total self-sufficiency is likely to mean reduced product choice and higher prices, as some parts of the world can grow the food more easily and cheaply.\\n\\nFor energy, at least, countries already have the blueprint to help beef up their resilience: turning to renewables can boost energy security while also cutting carbon emissions. Those plans may need to be accelerated if the UK and Europe are to move away from Russian gas at pace.\\n\\n“We\\'ve already decided that we want to get ourselves off gas over the next 20 years anyway\", says Sir John Armitt, chairman at the National Infrastructure Commission.\\n\\nHe adds that while efforts by Boris Johnson in Saudi Arabia this week to secure energy supplies “addresses a short term issue, it certainly doesn\\'t address our long term resilience or our long term infrastructure strategy when it comes to energy”.\\n\\nAlthough Russia\\'s invasion marks the latest blow to globalisation, building resilience by bringing supply closer to home will take time - and come at a cost.', 'I’d actually like to see Kyrgios win, but at this point doubting Nadal seems equal to climate change denial', 'I’m sure European countries would prefer to spend the money on other things, such as tackling climate change but we can’t escape the fact that T-72 tanks aren’t known for their low emissions.', 'Last week on r/science they had a super scary animation of 50 years of climate change ending in red. \\n\\nThey claimed it represented 1° of change over 50 years, but looking at the animation, you’d swear the end was near.', \"&gt; so you don’t see the things going on in the world? climate change, wars, global warming, rise of artificial intelligence…. with a possibility to replace human intelligence \\n\\nI see all of that.

Wivenhoe was built as flood mitigation as a direct response to 74, and then over time it was relied on more and more as a supply of water as SEQ population grew and so now the dam has competing objectives. Release water all the time and keep the dam at &lt;50% capacity and you have flood mitigation for 'black swan' events, but conversely you don't have enough water to supply a population that has grown 5x since 74. Hold on to too much water to supply the population, and you can't dump water fast enough during significant rainfall events to keep the dam levels low enough to prevent dam failure.\\n\\nBrisbanites considered that floods like 74 were a thing of the past with Wivenhoe built, and they started to raise the old Queenslanders and add bedrooms underneath them. 2011 came along and the main reason why Brisbane flooded was because of the aforementioned contention between managing the dam for both water supply and flood mitigation. They had just come out of a long drought and were holding on to water to ensure enough for supply, this meant there was not enough capacity to cope with the 2011 rainfall event - they made the call to flood Brisbane to prevent a dam failure. Coming out of 2011 everyone thought, 'well, we learnt our lesson about releasing enough water from the dam to allow for flood mitigation this probably won't happen again'.\\n\\nThis time around I would say that it will be different - a lot of Queenslanders will be thinking - Wivenhoe cannot protect us anymore, even if it is relatively well managed like it was in 2022, and it will only get worse with climate change. I expect you will see a change in attitudes now. Just my speculation anyway.\", 'Still significantly closer to midnight than climate change.

This is a political sea change which could easily be underestimated. Germany is up to now dependent on Russian gas, oil and coal. The Russian oligarchs have earned billions with this dependence. They are who gave Putin power. But the German government is now determined to change the dependence on fossil fuels. It *will* do this because it is our only way to assure our survival as humanity.  Europe as a whole will do it, too.\\n\\nFor Russia, this means that the oligarchs which support Putin are going to run out of money - with sanctions or without them.

Yet when medical technology advances to the point where we (as a society) can engineer biological methods to combat pandemics, these people suddenly lose faith in technology.  The evolution of diagnostic tools, to the point that we can genetically sequence a virus and identify point mutations opens up opportunities for prophylactic intervention, such as engineering cellular-level instructions on how to resist the infection (which is what mRNA technology does).  We also have the ability to diagnose side-effects (such as the blood-clotting issue being linked to a surface protein variant that is very rare in the population) at a level which was inconceivable even a decade ago.  \\n\\nPerhaps, the issue is that (some) people have a hard time understanding how the physical world actually works, and that what we need are better science communicators who can explain in terms that the average science neophyte can understand, what's underlying the technology we all use.

Positions that attribute nuclear energy an important role in\\xa0climate change mitigation\\xa0emerge.\\n\\n\\nWe estimate an upper bound of the CO2\\xa0saving potential of various nuclear energy growth scenarios, starting from our projection of nuclear generating capacity based on current national energy plans to scenarios that introduce nuclear energy as substantial instrument for climate protection. We then look at needed uranium resources.\\n\\n\\nThe most important result of the present work is that the contribution of nuclear power to mitigate climate change is, and will be, very limited. At present nuclear power avoids annually 2–3% of total global\\xa0GHG emissions. Looking at announced plans for new nuclear builds and lifetime extensions this value would decrease even further until 2040. Furthermore, a substantial expansion of nuclear power will not be possible because of technical obstacles and limited resources. Limited uranium-235 supply inhibits substantial expansion scenarios with the current nuclear technology. New nuclear technologies, making use of uranium-238, will not be available in time. Even if such expansion scenarios were possible, their climate change mitigation potential would not be sufficient as single action.', \"Say what you want about Gohmert's idiotic statement, but we got a Tea Bagger Movement Republican to admit climate change is real.\", \"&gt; level of detail they contain about, e.g., fire causes.\\n\\nIsn't it enough to know today's fires are caused by wo-men made climate change only and exclusively?

There are feedback loops which regulate earths climate. \\n\\nFor example, increased warming generally increases the intensity of storm events (this isn’t true across the board but in general wet places get wetter and dry places get drier). Increase precipitation will increase rock weathering (rain is slightly acidic (from the CO2 in the atmosphere reacting with water) and breaks down rocks slowly as rain is in contact with the rock surface). The increased weathering and water flow will carry dissolved elements into river waters which ultimately empty into the oceans. The carbon in dissolved in these waters (from all that weathering) reacts with calcium and magnesium (and other elements) and is slowly buried at the bottom of the ocean eventually turning into rock (limestone/dolostone). This process eventually draws down increases in atmospheric carbon and results in global cooling. \\n\\nThe problem is this does not occur on human time scales. So while the earth can eventually heal itself it will be long, long after the point when we (and everything else) were fucked as a species.\\n\\nThe other issue is the rate that we’re changing the planet.

Its always there, and its supposed to be there. \\n\\nYou probably heard about it during a severe cold snap, when meteorologists blamed the polar vortex for below average temperatures. What really happened is that the polar vortex--which normally stays over the poles--dropped down a mass of arctic air to lower latitudes, causing the cold snap.\\n\\nThe polar vortex is essentially kept in place by the polar jet stream. Jet streams are fast moving, high altitude air currents that circulate generally west to east around the earth. They tend to form at the boundary between warmer and cooler air masses and act to keep them separate. \\n\\nSometimes, a jet stream meanders, bending to the north or south. When this happens, warm or cold fronts form, as the different air masses that are usually kept in place are allowed to spill out. That cold snap was the result of the polar jet meandering much farther south than usual, allowing the arctic air of the polar vortex to spill south.\\n\\nThis is--somewhat counter intuitively--one of the ways that climate change that leads to warming on average can result in occasional extreme cold. \\n\\nJet streams are powered by the north-south temperature difference across them. The larger the temperature gradient, the stronger the jet. As the climate warms, the poles are warming faster than average, decreasing the temperature gradient, and thus weakening the jet stream. This increases the chances of such large meanders and occasional arctic outbreaks.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the pole doesn't just run out of air, it has to be replaced from somewhere. So while the cold air is flowing south in one area, another has warm air flowing north. During the 2014 cold snap in eastern north america, it was 20 F below average. But, at the same time in alaska, it was at least that much *above* average as warm air was drawn up to replace the cold air lost from the poles. \\n\\nThe problem isn't the polar vortex, its that it's not staying over the poles. This makes the temperate areas too cold, and the poles too warm.\", \"I'm all for trying to prevent any climate change, but so far the climate isn't that different from what  it used to be... it goes through cycles (for some reasons that are probably unknown).\", ' Pretty sure all people admit climate change is real, but some deny that humans caused it', \"Robots have been around for a long time in the pharmacy world.

I can\\'t say I\\'m particularly well-educated on it, beyond basic college environmental science and reading the book \"Collapse\" some years ago, but I have some idle thoughts as I read what you\\'ve written. \\n\\nLike you, I think that an impending collapse is not something instantaneous. However, I question your timeline for one reason: The technologies we have today, combined with the sheer magnitude of stress upon the earth\\'s resources as a whole, along with an awareness that the pressures on those natural resources has increased exponentially since the onset of the industrial era in the late 19th century, all lead me to conclude that the gradual part has been in play for a long time already. \\n\\nThe second point that comes to my mind is whether the extent of collapse is comparable. You described cities that collapsed and ultimately lead to individual civilizations collapsing, and I think your description of the process is outstanding and accurate. However, the trade routes that existed for any prior civilizations were extremely limited by comparison to the trade channels today, both in the depth of WHAT is traded, as well as the trade routes that make such a wide array of products available to such a wide array of peoples. This would seem to prolong a civilization\\'s ability to endure as long as the resources hold out, yet the resources themselves will deplenish far faster because of the extensive demand that can be created. This would be another factor that I suspect could speed the timeline of a collapse today compared to any other point in history, and also affect more cities simultaneously than any prior collapse has seen. \\n\\nThe book Collapse highlighted something like five factors that contribute to collapses. IIRC, they were a) depleted access to resources, b) diminished trade of those resources, c) political influences/war d) religious influences, and e) weather/climate change. The author made a great study of these factors and a solid argument that we are basically reliant on and subject to the earth\\'s health.
